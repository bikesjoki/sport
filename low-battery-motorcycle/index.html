Low Battery Start up on Motorcycle YouTube From youtube.com
The relationship between your motorcycle battery and engine functions much in the same way as a car battery. The majority of classic motorcycle batteries are of the conventional lead acid variety. Low charge in the battery, probably in need of replacement or a good charge (once the voltage drops below 12.4 volts, a battery will struggle to start the bike, especially in the winter!). I belieive a low battery can also cause these symtoms.
