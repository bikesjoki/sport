<p>So i unplugged everything but the main wires, the ones that control the starting and kill switch but that didnt help, i noticed 2 fuses were blown so i replaced those and that didnt help. Check the reading on your screen. It may very well start after that. My �03 xlh won�t start. With your poor starting you might of fouled the plugs in turn makin it hard work for yourself again.</p>

<p>Are a few bikes out there where if you run the starter without the plugs in them it will hurt somthing electrical, so to be on the safe side i hook up the plugs to the wires and lay the plugs on the engine so they can spark while you turn the motor over to air out the cylander.also this.

<p>You can measure some resistances by pulling the plugs off the tci unit. Change the plugs and charge the battery. But, when the key is rotated back for some reason i do get spark &amp; the unburned fuel lights off in. Check if its getting fuel and air, you need all 3 to make it run, if you have all.

<p>Now, hold the plug up to a head bolt or some other metal and turn the engine over. However, if the engine runs momentarily and dies, then the problem is that fuel is not getting to the cylinders. Check, if it has one, the oil sensor by unplugging it. If you have time, allow the motorcycle to sit until everything. 2003 Kawasaki ZRX 1200R walk around and startup YouTube.</p>

<p>Once it starts up, slowly release the throttle. If the reading is any lower than this, you won’t be going anywhere without a charge. Anything over 12.4 should get you started.

<p>Are a few bikes out there where if you run the starter without the plugs in them it will hurt somthing electrical, so to be on the safe side i hook up the plugs to the wires and lay the plugs on the engine so they can spark while you turn the motor over to air out the cylander.also this.

<p>Check, if it has one, the oil sensor by unplugging it. Now put the separate leads on the two battery posts (if you’re reading a negative number, that just means you need to switch the leads to the other battery post). 1 of 2 go to page.
