California Motorcycle Laws Is It Legal to Carry Someone on Your Motorbike? From williamweisslaw.com
The problem comes into play when you step off the bike. Can i legally carry a firearm on my bike? Unloaded locked in the vehicle�s trunk or in a separate locked container other than the utility or glove compartment if the vehicle does not have a trunk, it must be carried in a locked container separate from the utility or glove compartment. This is because i find my normal concealed carry holster to be uncomfortable while sitting on my motorcycle (a sport bike), likely due to the sport bike seating position and the geometry of the motorcycle seat and gas tank.
