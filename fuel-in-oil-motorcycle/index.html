First, fuel availability affects what is built for a market. A thinner engine oil will have less resistance to flow and using a thinner oil could increase your motorcycle’s peak power by as much as 5%. When oil can’t do its job properly, these parts start to create a lot of friction and then the engine could overheat. Another reason this is a problem is because when gas and oil mix, this causes the oil to lose its ability to lubricate the engine parts.
