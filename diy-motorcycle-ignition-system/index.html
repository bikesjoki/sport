electronic CDI circuit with 12V battery operation Electronic circuit From pinterest.com
As discussed before ( cdi system working principle ), the cdi system is very different from conventional ignition systems such as battery ignition or magneto ignition. This would give a (wasted) spark each revolution of the crankshaft. This article originally appeared in the june 1988 issue of gas engine magazine. Fyi the ignition coil is the part that is actually turned on and off when you turn to key on (in relation to the engine) and its main job is to multiply the engergy from the 12 volt battery system so it can send a really hot spark to jump the gap on the spark plug thus igniting the air/fuel ratio.
