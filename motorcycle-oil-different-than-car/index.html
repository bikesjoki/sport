10w30 vs 10w40 Engine Oil Viscosity Differences The Vehicle Lab From thevehiclelab.com
There�s no real difference between motorcycle oil filters and car filters.they function exactly the same way and they perform the exact same function which is filter the oil.there are differences in materials used and quality between brands but these differences in materials and quality are not specific to motorcycles or cars and there is no real functional. If you put in automotive oil into your motorbike engine, this can result in the clutch slipping and the transmission becoming damaged. If it is not necessary they wouldn’t have bothered. The general rule is to change the oil every 100 km, but if you are an aggressive rider and use your atv often, then it is better to check the oil levels regularly.
