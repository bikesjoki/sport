SBC Stealth 4150 4 Barrel Fuel Injection Conversion Kit, Sniper EFI From hawksmotorsports.com
It is designed to convert some carburetor engines of 400cc to 800cc range. Calibration was done on the dynamometer for power and engine performance. Other similar fuel injection kits available in the market are too expensive. Many of the classic fuel injection cars can be set to run in closed loop fuelling mode at 14.7:1 afr ( air fuel ratio ) to give better fuel control, improved fuel economy and reduced exhaust emissions.
