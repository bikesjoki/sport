Florida law 316.209 says that other drivers must give you full use of a lane. A person operating a motorcycle or moped shall ride only upon the permanent and regular seat attached thereto, and such operator shall not carry any other person, nor shall any other person ride on a motorcycle or moped, unless such motorcycle or moped is designed to carry more. If 50cc or less, these vehicles are not motorcycles by driver license law definition, section 322.01 (26), florida statutes so a motorcycle endorsement is not needed per section 322.03(4), florida statutes. You can ride motorcycles without a helmet in florida, but you do need eye protection and at least $10,000 of personal injury protection motorcycle insurance.
