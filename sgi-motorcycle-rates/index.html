There are multiple different rate groups within sgi. Don morgan, the minister responsible for sgi, said what the new changes will accomplish. This year, even with record profits, and unprecedented refunds averaging of $285 per vehicle, sgi insists that motorcycle riders are not covering the cost of their insurance claims, and have published proposed motorcycle rate increases of about 10% for january, 2021. If the rate review panel and provincial government both approve the changes, they would take effect august 31, 2013.
