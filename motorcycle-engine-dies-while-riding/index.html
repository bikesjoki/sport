<p>Continuously riding with rough throttle, high revving etc can make the engine so much stressed that the engine can easily overheat. When an engine runs lean, that means the air to fuel ration is off and there’s either not enough fuel or too much air. Three riders died in the 1940s; When you disassembled the engine and removed the head you must have removed the rubber intake manifolds. A motorcycle dislikes speed wobbles as much as its rider and will attempt to rectify the problem by centering the wheel as fast as possible.</p>
