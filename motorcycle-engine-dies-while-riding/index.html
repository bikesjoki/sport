When an engine runs lean, that means the air to fuel ration is off and thereâs either not enough fuel or too much air. Three riders died in the 1940s; When you disassembled the engine and removed the head you must have removed the rubber intake manifolds. A motorcycle dislikes speed wobbles as much as its rider and will attempt to rectify the problem by centering the wheel as fast as possible.</p>
