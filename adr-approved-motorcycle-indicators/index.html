Narva led headlight globes work around this issue by being adjustable to suit different headlight designs, however, in order to become adr compliant, the process of converting to led globes would need to be foolproof without a need to adjust. Front direction indicators of categories 1a and 1b as described in paragraph 6.1. Great whites led daytime running lights (drls) and led headlight inserts have been classified as adr compliant, making them the safe choice when upgrading the lighting on your vehicle. It is acceptable to have a high/low beam headlamp mounted side by side with a driving light, provided that they are mounted symmetrically about the centre line of the motorcycle.
