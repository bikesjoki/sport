Also, use a plastic container, not a glass one, because getting the mold out of the container requires that you cut it out. Attach one cable from the power wire to each brake switch (front and back) and another wire from the brake switches to the taillight. You have to get the mold out of the container so that you can peel away the sides and remove the clay model. I have completed 6 assemblies using the same components that i am listing for this build, with great success and not one led failure.
