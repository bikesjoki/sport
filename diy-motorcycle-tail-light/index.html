Also, use a plastic container, not a glass one, because getting the mold out of the container requires that you cut it out.

You have to get the mold out of the container so that you can peel away the sides and remove the clay model. I have completed 6 assemblies using the same components that i am listing for this build, with great success and not one led failure.
