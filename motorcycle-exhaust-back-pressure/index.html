<p>While reducing back pressure is necessary, you also want the exhaust gases to have a minimum velocity. Backpressure is the opposing force that forces the gas from the exhaust to flow through the limited system. I�m sure many of you have heard or read the phrase engines need back pressure when discussing exhaust upgrades. As jason explains, a restrictive exhaust flow that builds up back pressure is only hurting the power your vehicle can deliver because it�s not working efficiently. The classic symptoms of too much backpressure include things like a lack of high speed power, poor fuel economy and even overheating.</p>
