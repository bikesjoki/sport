Riders of motorcycles up to 125cc must be aged 16 or over, while moped (not exceeding 50cc) riders must be aged 14 or over. The union customs code (ucc) was adopted in 2013 and its substantive provisions apply from 1 may 2016. Minimum age for driving , provided you hold a full uk licence, is 18 for a car and for a motorcycle over 125cc. In most european countries motorcycle riders are expected to split lanes, and in some countries (france and italy for instance), you are even expected to ride between oncoming traffic and the cars driving the same direction as you, when there is only one lane for each direction.
