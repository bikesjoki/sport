Choosing the right engine oil A quick guide startrescue.co.uk From startrescue.co.uk
My experience is that engines have small variations in oil consumption due principally to how the piston rings seat into the cylinder wall during the early life of the engine. Larger carb dyna ignition ) will use some oil but 1 quart every 400 miles is a fricken joke, plugs look good for the most part, i dont drip excessive amounts one or 2 small drips here and there but not enough for a quart. Anyone else having to add oil to keep the level in the sight glass? This late in powersports history, when new motorcycles have advanced so incredibly and technical knowledge has become so accessible, i often find myself surprised that riders still don�t understand oil consumption, as demonstrated each time i am presented with the argument, common in many quarters, that since the spark plugs aren�t oily and the exhaust isn�t smoking,.
