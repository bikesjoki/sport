US Motorcycle Rear View Mirrors Edge Cut Black For HarleyDavidson From ebay.com
Many motorists set their side mirrors in ways that they’ll just begin to see the side of the vehicle within the mirrors. Rear traffic is almost as important to the motorcycle rider as traffic ahead. (1) every motor vehicle other than a motorcycle shall be equipped with, (b) a mirror or mirrors securely attached to the vehicle and placed in such a position as to afford the driver a clearly reflected view of the roadway in the rear, or of any vehicle approaching from the rear. However, as a motorcyclist you need to be fully aware of traffic around you at all times so it is highly advisable to have two mirrors.
