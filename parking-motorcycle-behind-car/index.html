Ten motorcycles per car parking space? From reinventingparking.org
If you have more than one motorcycle, you can still purchase standard season parking for $15 (surface car parks) or $17 (covered car parks), and park the motorcycle at your designated car park.

No it�s not legal parking (because your wheel is partially outside the marked space), but it�s still the car driver�s fault as far as insurance is concerned.
