The Pioneer Run Sunbeam Motorcycle Club From sunbeam-mcc.co.uk
First away was dave and mrs pittuck aboard an 1896 leon bollèe tricycle. Similar in style to the veteran car club’s ‘london to brighton run’ for old cars, the pioneer, is in fact, an earlier event, having been run more or less continually from 1930. 2021 marks the 81st running of the sunbeam motorcycle club’s pioneer run®. Over 200 enthusiasts entered the 2021 pioneer run, one of many events cancelled early last year due to the impending covid 19 lockdown.
