How To increase Mileage of motorcycle/70 air fuel ratio setting for From youtube.com
If you are using gasoline, the calculated air to fuel ratio to produce complete combustion is 14:7. Steady state, best power as high as 6.2 to 1. Lean mixtures (i.e., greater than 14.7) produce hotter combustion gases than does a stoichiometric mixture. You may lean it out a little to nearer 14:1 in the midrange at low throttle openings (cruising revs/throttle) but otherwise stick to this &amp; you wont go wrong.

Fuel screw is located on the carb but its near the engine. Lean mixtures (i.e., greater than 14.7) produce hotter combustion gases. 37mm Compact Micro Digital Smoked Air/Fuel Ratio Gauge Universal 3 4 6.</p>
