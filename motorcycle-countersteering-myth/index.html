<meta name="description" content="Motorcycle Countersteering Myth, When you lean your body into the turn, your arm is actually pushing on the handlebar, countersteering the bike into the turn. Once a certain lean angle is reached, the rider unconsciously stops countersteering and by releasing the strength in his or her arms, the bike will naturally keep the handlebars turned in the direction of the corner.
Bikes that REALLY blow your hair back. Page 696 Triumph Forum From triumphrat.net
This myth propagates as changes in body position executed badly cause a torque on the bars and thus turning. Furthermore one cannot steer a bike by leaning alone. The throttle is controlled by twisting the right handlebar grip. A motorcycle turns by leaning.
