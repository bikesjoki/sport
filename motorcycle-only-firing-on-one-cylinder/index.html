If you are running single fire, you can run a jumper wire from the front cylinder neg terminal to the rear cylinder neg terminal, remove the rear cylinder wire that goes to the ignition module and then switch the ingnition module to dual fire.

The readings should be similar. If you swap the control wires and the spark plug wires to the opposite sides of the coil you will be using the opposite coil windings for each cylinder. If single fire, check each spark plug terminal against the appropriate neg terminal. The black and green wires connect to the ic igniter(if the bike has the kawasaki supplied electronic ignition) it actually gives the coils their grounds to fire the sparkplugs.

<p>It�s just trying not to get messy, of course. One bank runs, the other doesn�t. These are commonly called a “wasted spark” ignition. Cylinder #2, 4 and 6 are on the passenger side with #2 in the front and #6 in the back. The pipe where the cylinder is firing will vaporize the water.

<p>My the other firing cylinders will have these manifolds warm/hot to the touch. The spark on the compression stroke will ignite the gas/air mixture and the spark on the exhaust stroke will do nothing.

<p>If you swap the control wires and the spark plug wires to the opposite sides of the coil you will be using the opposite coil windings for each cylinder.

<p>There is also a lot of backfiring out of the non running cylinders, both through the carbs as well as out the exhaust. The spark on the compression stroke will ignite the gas/air mixture and the spark on the exhaust stroke will do nothing. Second do a compression test on both cylinders, if. Then i can leave it that way. Hayabusa Gen 1 2000, 2 &amp; 3 Cylinders Not Firing, Losing Coolant.</p>

If either the 1 or 4 cylinder is firing, the problem probably isn�t the coil. With the fuel tank removed i put a fuel bottle to the fuel line before the fuel filter/pump, fired up the bike and watched, quickly learning that the front cylinder was not firing, possibly a little, but very hard to tell. Come join the discussion about performance. If single fire, check each spark plug terminal against the appropriate neg terminal. If i pull the choke out any further then a quarter inch (all the way out is about 1.5 inches) only one piston fires.</p>
<p>If you are running single fire, you can run a jumper wire from the front cylinder neg terminal to the rear cylinder neg terminal, remove the rear cylinder wire that goes to the ignition module and then switch the ingnition module to dual fire. And if i unplug the spark plug wire nothing changes. If only one flashes or you see uneven flashes the ckp is culprit or one of the wires is open. <em>Hayabusa Gen 1 2000, 2 &amp; 3 Cylinders Not Firing, Losing Coolant</em>, Cylinder #2, 4 and 6 are on the passenger side with #2 in the front and #6 in the back.</p>
