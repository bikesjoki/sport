2020 RR water in fuse box issue (bike won�t start, dash won�t turn on From s1000rrforum.com
This is an old thread, but it came up with some google searching and helped resolve my bike issue. What would cause a motorcycle not to start? Just had this same problem with a buddys sporty last weekend, we where out on a ride, stoped for gas and soda and his bike would not start, only make a clicking sound. Fortunately, there are other troubleshooting means that can help determine why your bike won’t start.
