Best Headphones For Bike Riding 2021 Nonstop Techno From nonstoptechno.com
While many riders enjoy listening to audio on the road, some methods are safer than others. It works really well, but i make it a point to avoid any adrenaline inducing music while riding. I�d guess it�s illegal here in california, since with the headset law (using phones in car requires headset/speaker), you cannot use headsets that cover both ears. I wear shooting earplugs while i ride, so i can hear everything, but any loud noise is cut off.
